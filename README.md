# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
One way to interpret and implement user needs is by using user stories. User stories provide the development team with a short description of a program from the user’s point of view. User stories do a good job of letting the development know exactly what the client wants the program to do and any requirements that they might have. From there, we are able to gather the information and use it to create a product that satisfies all the client’s needs.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs I intend the follow the agile methodology because of its flexibility and how closely I am able to work with the client. In the future, I intend to incorporate daily scrum meetings and sprint retrospectives in any development work. The scrum meetings will allow the development team to touch on tasks completed, tasks to be completed, and any obstacles that team members are facing. The sprint retrospective will be held at the end of a sprint and will revolve around discussions of the previous and upcoming sprints.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is one who knows how to effectively communicate with the other members of the team. They know are able to listen, interpret and respond with constructive feedback. A good team member must also be self-efficient, needing little to no interference when completing sprints.
